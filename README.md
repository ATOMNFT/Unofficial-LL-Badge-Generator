# 🐼 Unofficial Lazy Lion Badge Generator V2

This is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that allows users to:

- ✅ Generate a customized badges with your Lion on it  
- ✅ Download and share your badge on social media  
- ✅ Choose from multiple artwork styles  
<br>

I built this to learn a few things to do with Canvas API and figured I'd share it. I'll probably add more badges along the way.
